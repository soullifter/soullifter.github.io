I was born and brought up in **Railway Kodur, Kadapa District (Andhra Pradesh)**.  
Growing up in a middle-class family, I watched my parents sacrifice everything so I could have a better life. From a young age, I made a promise to myself: **I will be successful, no matter what.**

## Early Schooling
- Studied until 7th grade in **Sri Gouri Sankar EM High School** (my hometown).  
- Later moved to **Viswabharathi High School** to build a stronger foundation.  

Even then, I set my first big goal: **score 10/10 in 10th standard** and join the prestigious *Chinna Batch* (a special IIT coaching program by Chaitanya & Narayana).  
And I achieved it.

## Junior College (Intermediate)
I dedicated myself fully â€” **missed family functions, outings, and comforts** â€” because I wanted only one thing: success.  

- **IIT JEE Mains:** *330 Rank (General Category)*  
- **JEE Advanced:** *233 Rank (General Category)*  
- **AP EAMCET & TS EAMCET:** *15th Rank*  
- And many other competitive exams.  

Each milestone was proof that **hard work + clarity beats everything**.

## IIT Kharagpur
I entered **IIT KGP, Computer Science** â€” one of the toughest and most rewarding journeys.  
- Mastered **core CS fundamentals**  
- Specialized in **Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning**  
- Internship at **Samsung**  
- Final placements â†’ **direct US job at ThirdAI**

---

## Career
- Started my career in the US with **ThirdAI** (direct from campus).  
- Now working at **ServiceNow** in the US, growing both career & compensation.  
- Alongside, building a **crazy business journey** in parallel.

## The Mission
My journey is still going. Iâ€™ve ticked off many dreams, but there are **many more ahead**.  

And now through **Path2Destiny**, I want to **guide others** â€” students, graduates, professionals â€” to reach their own dreams with **clarity, accountability, and relentless drive**.

âœ¨ Want to see the dreams Iâ€™ve already ticked and the ones Iâ€™m chasing?
