## Current Features

Our product is designed to streamline every aspect of prospect management and team coordination for direct selling distributors. Key features include:

- **Detailed Prospect Tracking:**  
  Effortlessly manage your contacts with comprehensive tracking of every interaction. Know who has been contacted, when the conversation occurred, and what was discussed—ensuring that no prospect is overlooked.

- **CSV Import Functionality:**  
  Import existing data from Excel or other spreadsheets using a pre-defined column format. This feature makes it simple for current distributors to transition their existing contact lists into the system.

- **Advanced Filtering System:**  
  Use both basic and advanced filter options to sort and segment your prospects, enabling you to quickly identify key opportunities and take targeted actions.

- **AI-Powered Suggestions:**  
  Benefit from intelligent, AI-driven suggestions integrated throughout the platform. Receive recommendations on follow-up actions, conversation topics, and next steps to enhance your engagement with prospects.

- **Handler Support for Team Coordination:**  
  Our product includes dedicated support for assigning mentors or handlers to specific stages (e.g., Qualifier, UL1, UL2, etc.). Even if a handler is new to a prospect’s history, they can quickly access the full context of past interactions when assigned to that stage.

- **Comprehensive Team Tracking:**  
  Mentors can monitor the progress of all mentees, prepare tailored agendas, and provide actionable guidance on how to improve prospect engagement and overall performance.

## Future Features

We are continuously innovating to bring you even more value. Planned enhancements include:

1. **Automated Process Simulations:**

2. **Enhanced Performance Analytics:**  
   Gain access to detailed graphs and reports that display your historical progress. Identify areas where you’re excelling, spot bottlenecks, and receive suggestions on how to improve your performance.

3. **Personalized Goal-Setting Tools:**  
   Capture and organize your aspirations by recording your dreams and mapping them to actionable plans. Our future tools will help you plan strategically, with timelines and milestones to track your journey toward success.
