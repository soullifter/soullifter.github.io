**You can write your own story.**  
Not coaching. Not shortcuts. Just **guidance + accountability**.

## ðŸš€ What Youâ€™ll Get
- **Clarity on your goals**  
  Weâ€™ll sit together and break down your goals into **short-term, mid-term, and long-term goals**.  
  No more confusion about **what to do next**. 


- **Weekly 2 simple actions**  
  Instead of long to-do lists, youâ€™ll commit to **just 2 small but powerful actions every week**.  
  This keeps you consistent without overwhelming you.  


- **Guidance + accountability**  
  I wonâ€™t do things *for you* â€” but Iâ€™ll **show you the path, check your progress, and push you forward** when you slow down.  
  Youâ€™ll always know someoneâ€™s got your back.
