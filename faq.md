**Q: What is Path2Destiny?**  
Path2Destiny is a **guidance + accountability system**. I wonâ€™t spoon-feed or do the work for you â€” I will **guide, track, and navigate** while you take consistent actions.  

---

**Q: What are the Five Buckets? Why do they matter?**  
Everyone fits into one stage:  
1. School (up to 10th)  
2. College (Intermediate / 11thâ€“12th)  
3. Undergrad/Grad (projects, internships, placements)  
4. Graduate looking for jobs  
5. Working professionals  

Buckets matter because each stage has different needs. When you know your bucket, youâ€™ll get the **right guidance for your level** â€” not too advanced, not too basic.  

---

**Q: What is Pathfinder 1:1? Do I need to take it first?**  
Yes. Pathfinder 1:1 is the **first step**. Itâ€™s a one-time program with **2 personal sessions (20 min each, within a month)**.  
- Session 1: Define **Short / Mid / Long-term goals** and create a roadmap.  
- Session 2: Review and refine goals after 15 days.  
- Passive support: Iâ€™m also available over text in between.  

This ensures you have **clarity** before moving into Circle, Premium, or Ultimate.  

---

**Q: Whatâ€™s included in Circle?**  
- Access to your **bucket group(s)**  
- **2 small actions per week** that everyone commits to  
- You can ask questions anytime in the group  
- **Monthly group call** for your bucket  

Itâ€™s about **accountability and consistency** with people like you.

**Q: Whatâ€™s the difference between Circle, Premium Circle, and Ultimate 1:1?**  
- **Circle (â‚¹999/month):** Group + weekly 2 actions + monthly call  
- **Premium Circle (â‚¹1,999/month):** Circle + **2 personal 1:1 calls per month**  
- **Ultimate 1:1 (â‚¹7,999/month):** Circle + **weekly 30-min 1:1 call** (limited spots)  

---

**Q: How do subscriptions work?**  
- Circle, Premium, and Ultimate are **monthly memberships**.  
- You need to renew every month to continue.  
- After each payment, fill the Google Form with your Payment ID so we can verify and extend your membership.  
- If you forget to renew, youâ€™ll simply get a **reminder** â€” so you can continue without losing momentum.  

---

**Q: What happens after payment?**  
1. Complete the Google Form (Name, Email, Phone, Plan, Payment ID).  
2. We verify your payment.  
3. You get:  
   - WhatsApp Community link (for your bucket)  
   - Intake checklist  
   - Call scheduling link (based on your plan)  
4. You start with **two small actions this week**.  

---

**Q: Can I upgrade later?**  
Yes. You can always move up. Just pay the difference for the remaining period. Example: Circle â†’ Premium, or Premium â†’ Ultimate.  

---

**Q: What if I canâ€™t keep up with weekly actions?**  
Itâ€™s okay. The goal is **progress, not perfection**. If you miss something, we reflect, adjust, and keep moving forward.  

---

**Q: Do you help with international paths (MS / US jobs)?**  
Yes, but at a **guidance level**.  
I can **look over your resume, SOP, and direction** and help you think clearly, but I donâ€™t provide full-scale coaching or interview prep. The focus is clarity and navigation.  

---

**Q: Do you offer refunds?**  
ðŸš« **No refund policy.**  
I promise to give you my **best guidance and support**. Your responsibility is to **walk the path** with commitment. Growth requires seriousness from both sides.  

---

**Q: Do I need to start only on a specific date?**  
No. You can start anytime. Onboarding happens as soon as you subscribe, and youâ€™ll join the next cycle of weekly actions immediately.  

---

**Q: How much time do I need to commit?**  
- Weekly actions take **30â€“60 minutes**.  
- Calls:  
  - Pathfinder 1:1: 2 short calls in a month  
  - Circle: 1 monthly call  
  - Premium: 2 extra 1:1s  
  - Ultimate: 1 weekly 1:1  
Consistency is more important than hours.  

---

**Q: Can school/college students and working professionals be in the same group?**  
No â€” thatâ€™s the point of the **buckets**. Youâ€™ll be placed with people in the **same stage as you**, so your actions and discussions are always relevant.
