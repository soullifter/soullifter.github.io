**Q: When do cohorts start?**  
Every Monday. You’ll get onboarding steps right after payment.

**Q: Can I upgrade later?**  
Yes. You only pay the difference for the remaining period.

**Q: Refund policy?**  
If you attend the first live session and feel it’s not for you, request a refund within 7 days.

**Q: Do you help with international paths (MS/US jobs)?**  
Yes—SOP/Resume, strategy, referrals guidance, and interview prep are core parts of the program.
